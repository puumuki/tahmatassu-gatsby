## Tahmatassu Gatsby

This is just a test project for trying out what you can do with Gatsby framework. Tahmatassu is a Python project that I made some years ago and me and my house hold is using almost daily. It's a webserver witch server receipts. 

It has a own web server made wiht Python and Flask. It exposes recipes trough REST api, so I used that REST interface to fetch those receipes and tried how the Gatsby works.

`Gatsby`, `React` and `GraphQL` are new for me but I managed to at least get something working in one day time. 

Nice.

Gatsby creates a static web sites using React framework. GraphQL is used to handle data queries.. kinda like SQL but in internal things. I ended up facing some wierd cave bats while working with GraphQL.. I could not reuse those queries in multiple page nor in multiple components.. so the code is what it's. This was just a experiment.

I got nice SVG icons working easily on the site.. thanks to React icon thingy thing..

I liked the integrated GraphQl development enviroment, it made easy to create the needed queries. I see the popential there. In somehow I like to do thing in more lower level, in Javascript... it might be just that JS is more familiar for mew.

Hmm.. well in in all it was a good learning experience :)

Tahmatassu is currently just running on my local network so.. if you ever try to reuse this pile of code try to find some other data source.
